			<h3 id="home-header-3">About Me</h3>
			<p>My name is Ella Kowaleski and I am a sophomore at the University of South Carolina. 
			I am majoring in psychology and minoring in biology. 
			I am from a small town in Wisconsin but decided to come all the way down here to South Carolina to get away from the people in my hometown. 
			I was labeled a shy, quiet, girl in high school and I didn't want that to come into college with me. 
			Nobody ever came down here, so it seemed like the perfect decision for me, and so far it has been!</p>
			<p id="mymessage" class="hidden">I am a part of the Kappa Gamma chapter of the sorority Alpha Xi Delta. 
			I am the Circle of Sisterhood Delegate for my chapter as well. 
			I am also a part of the Fundraising Committee for USC's Relay For Life team. 
			Outside of school work, I enjoy going out with friends, having movie nights, and relaxing by myself. 
			A downside of living so far away is that I don't get to see my family often. 
			I am really close with both my parents as well as my younger sister and brother.
			Another downside, I don't get to see my dog often either. 
			She's a labrador retriever named Raven and she has my whole heart. </p>

			<h3 id="home-header-3">My Future Career Plans</h3>
			<p>My future plans include becoming an Animal Physical Therapist, specifically dogs. 
			This means finishing undergraduate a semester early and then going to graduate school, specifically Physical Therapy. 
			I have not decided quite yet where I want to go to graduate school, my choices so far include; South Carolina, Wisconsin, or somewhere out west like Colorado or Montana. 
			My thought process is that I only live once, so while I'm young with not many commitments, I should try to go everywhere possible. 
			I might take a gap year between undergrad and grad school so I can be a traveling pet sitter but that is still up in the air. 
			After grad school, I will go to Tennessee to get certified to work on animals. </p>
			
			<p id="mymessage" class="hidden">After all my schooling is done, I will move back to my hometown. 
			I think I'm going to need to work in a hospital as a Physical Therapist on humans for a little bit to save up some money. 
			When I have enough money saved, then I will open my own Physical Therapy clinic for dogs. 
			If my grandma will be ready to sell her house, I will want to buy it because it has a barn where I can convert it to my business area. 
			There will always be a dog in my life, I'm hoping after undergrad, but I plan on adopting a dog every 5 years. </p>
