				<h3 id="home-header-3">About Me</h3>
				<p>My name is Ella Kowaleski and I am a sophomore at the University of South Carolina. 
				I am majoring in psychology and minoring in biology. 
				I am from a small town in Wisconsin but decided to come all the way down here to South Carolina to get away from the people in my hometown. 
				I was labeled a shy, quiet, girl in high school and I didn't want that to come into college with me. 
				Nobody ever came down here, so it seemed like the perfect decision for me, and so far it has been!</p>
				
				<p id="mymessage" class="hidden">I am a part of the Kappa Gamma chapter of the sorority Alpha Xi Delta. 
				I am the Circle of Sisterhood Delegate for my chapter as well. 
				I am also a part of the Fundraising Committee for USC's Relay For Life team. 
				Outside of school work, I enjoy going out with friends, having movie nights, and relaxing by myself. 
				A downside of living so far away is that I don't get to see my family often. 
				I am really close with both my parents as well as my younger sister and brother.
				Another downside, I don't get to see my dog often either. 
				She's a labrador retriever named Raven and she has my whole heart. </p>

				<h3 id="home-header-3">My Future Career Plans</h3>
				<p>My future plans include becoming an Animal Physical Therapist, specifically dogs. 
				This means finishing undergraduate a semester early and then going to graduate school, specifically Physical Therapy. 
				I have not decided quite yet where I want to go to graduate school, my choices so far include; South Carolina, Wisconsin, or somewhere out west like Colorado or Montana. 
				My thought process is that I only live once, so while I'm young with not many commitments, I should try to go everywhere possible. 
				I might take a gap year between undergrad and grad school so I can be a traveling pet sitter but that is still up in the air. 
				After grad school, I will go to Tennessee to get certified to work on animals. </p>
			
				<p id="mymessagetwo" class="hidden">After all my schooling is done, I will move back to my hometown. 
				I think I'm going to need to work in a hospital as a Physical Therapist on humans for a little bit to save up some money. 
				When I have enough money saved, then I will open my own Physical Therapy clinic for dogs. 
				If my grandma will be ready to sell her house, I will want to buy it because it has a barn where I can convert it to my business area. 
				There will always be a dog in my life, I'm hoping after undergrad, but I plan on adopting a dog every 5 years. </p>
